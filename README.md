# Hi there, I'm Raymond Svejd

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a high school teacher with a love for Modelling, Programming and Technology.    

## About Me

- I've been teaching for over 10 years, specializing in C++, 3D modeling, and game engines.
- I primarily use SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for teaching C++ to my students. The easy visuals make it intuitive and fun for them.
- Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on integrating AI into education at my school, both theoretically and practically.

## My Interests

- **Programming**: I enjoy coding and teaching C++. It's great to see students understand new concepts and apply them in their own projects.
- **3D Modeling**: I like exploring 3D graphics and helping students create their own models and animations.
- **Game Development**: I use game engines to help students bring their ideas to life.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: I'm working on incorporating AI into education to make learning more effective and engaging.

## Projects

I am currently working on several projects and will be sharing them here soon. Stay tuned!
